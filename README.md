## Project
### [*Titanic Survival Analysis Project*](./project/Titanic)

This project uses the famous Titanic dataset (from Kaggle) to analyze passenger survival patterns.  
It aims to explore real-world business and data science related questions such as:

- finding out the key factors that influenced survival (e.g., gender, age, class)
- predicting passenger survival probability using machine learning models
- analyzing the effect of family size (sibsp, parch) on survival
- understanding how ticket fare and embarkation port impacted survival rate
- etc.

The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building predictive models.
